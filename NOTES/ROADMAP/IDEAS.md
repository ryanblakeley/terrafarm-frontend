# Terrafarm CSA Frontend Roadmap

## Ideas

- short-cut urls, such as:
  - terra.farm/u/dingus -> terra.farm/csa/user/dingus
  - terra.farm/f/double-fork-garden -> terra.farm/csa/farm/double-fork-garden
- crops: mix across products and have species detail and schedules
- css transition composition when https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2680 lands
- maybe add webpack-dev-server inside `if (isDeveloping)` in `frontend/server.js`
- mail server
- maybe change User -> Person
- landing bumper
  - logo with full name animates into top left corner
  - login button fades in to top right corner
  - tagline fades in to center
- sticky footer
- add Geometos Rounded font for app logo
- eslint, babel, webpack config abstractions
- reading groups
- soil kits
- climate or weather data
- activity feed
- email and text message notifications
- new loading component
- relationships accordion collapse functionality
- ragged bottom edge to indicate scroll -- browse menu
- search results make the right arrow icon 3d
- customer and farmers can rate each other
- link to terrafarm from open source projects we're using
