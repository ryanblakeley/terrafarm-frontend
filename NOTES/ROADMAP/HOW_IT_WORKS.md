# Terrafarm Frontend Roadmap

## How it Works

- Resource owners post land, labor, equipment, and materials.
- People create tasks, projects, and organizations.
- Resource owners offer resources to tasks, projects, and organizations.
- Task authors, project authors, and organization members request resources in two ways:
    - from the Resource page
        - menu > request resource > select task/project/organization
    - from the task/project/organization page
        - menu > request resource > select from list of starred resources
- Offers and requests can be accepted or declined by the corresponding owner, author, or members.

- [work in progress] A messaging service for communication after offers/requests.
- [work in progress] Tasks can be attached to projects so that the project author can delegate project resources to the task.
- [work in progress] Projects can be attached to organizations so that organization members can delegate organization resources to the project.
- [work in progress] Joining an organization as a member
