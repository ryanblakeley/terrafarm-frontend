## v2.x

### 2.0.3

- Relay renderer user render callback for "not found" and "loading"
  - [x] product
  - [x] farm
  - [x] user
  - [x] profile
  - [x] share
  - [x] voucher
  - [x] browse
  - index redirect on /product/ /farm/ /share/ etc
- can browse queries and state by used better with Relay Router?
- contentSubheader link is full width hit area
- dev hot reload

- Browse
  - [ ] submit on enter
  - [ ] product page: location from farm?
- Form
  - error messages
    - Too many characters

### 2.0.4

- [ ] more big clean up
  - link as article header needs to be not full width
  - assign-share payload should update product.card_holders
  - maybe use link icon like content-library on anchors
  - assign/order punch card consolidated into one form and mutation "create punch card"?
  - deleting a product
  - since internet connection may not be great at markets and on farms, be sure profile page has all needed voucher tokens and maybe have a pdf download of vouchers
  - notes for shares or vouchers could be additive (arrays) rather than single items that get updated
  - customer contact should be email or phone
  - auto-generate vouchers and remove "create voucher"
  - allow for "double" or "half shares"
  - profile page voucher list, filter by status
  - maybe add date field(s) to voucher
  - maybe add status "ready" to voucher
  - RelationshipList pagination
  - Layout props for flex elements: MainContentWrapper
  - confirm all material-ui was switched over to shared components
  - might want to hide token unless user wants to see it
