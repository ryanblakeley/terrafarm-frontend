# Terrafarm CSA Frontend Roadmap

## v2.x

### 2.0.3

- [ ] fix relationship list item when no name
- [ ] fix content subheader text when no value
  - prop warningText, default (empty) or (not provided)

- [ ] format date to periods instead of dash between numbers and emdash instead of "to" between dates
- [ ] Form error messages

- [x] when user switches accounts, profile page doesn't update
  - [x] switch to new Relay.Environment API
- [x] lighten text in relationship list when "no description"

### 2.0.4

- [ ] more big clean up
  - RelationshipList pagination
  - share page should show how many credits were bought, maybe vouchers have #3/5
  - browse results, if list is empty, don't show any items
  - create voucher doesn't have a visible token--check API?
  - home page: show featured products
  - better icon for Share, maybe voucher, maybe product
  - make form text size responsive, bigger than it is currently on medium and large desktop
  - form start date and end date side by side
  - add location input to new user
  - remove yellow background focused text input (shows up on login/signup forms)
  - auto-generate vouchers and remove "create voucher"
  - don't show canceled shares as shareholders on product page
  - is batching possible with postgraphql yet?

### 2.0.5

- can browse page use router queries and state in a better way?
- image hosting
- might want to hide token unless user wants to see it
- deleting a product
- customer contact should be email or phone
- allow for "double" or "half shares"
- Layout props for flex elements

- since internet connection may not be great at markets and on farms, be sure profile page has all needed voucher tokens and maybe have a pdf download of vouchers
- notes for shares or vouchers could be additive (arrays) rather than single items that get updated
- maybe add date field(s) to voucher
- replace Google geocoding with PostGIS procedure
