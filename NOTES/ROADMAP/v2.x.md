# Terrafarm Roadmap

## v2.x

### 2.0.x

- user notifications
- language tunnel
- multiple images for profile (2), resource (3), land (5)

### 2.1.x

- business dashboards

### 2.2.x

- color relationships

### Other possibilities

#### Monetization
- resource pricing and transactions
- higher limits on: lands, projects, land admins
- custom short url with name, e.x. terra.farm/dunbar
- crowd funding portal
- vendor click-throughs for books, videos, and equipment
- loadouts: save frequent resource combinations

#### More ideas
- add Crop Schedules
- css transition composition when https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2680 lands
- maybe add webpack-dev-server inside `if (isDeveloping)` in `frontend/server.js`
- mail server
- maybe change User -> Person
- priority and status indicators rather than text
- landing bumper
  - logo with full name animates into top left corner
  - login button fades in to top right corner
  - tagline fades in to center
- alternate icon for organization:
  - torii gate by freepik: http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/torii-gate_68189#term=gate&page=1&position=15
- sticky footer
- add Geometos Rounded font for app logo
- eslint abstractions
- represent ecological diversity
- reading groups
- soil kits
- climate or weather data
