### 2.0.5

- can browse page use router queries and state in a better way?

- since internet connection may not be great at markets and on farms, be sure profile page has all needed voucher tokens and maybe have a pdf download of vouchers
- notes for shares or vouchers could be additive (arrays) rather than single items that get updated
- maybe add date field(s) to voucher
- replace Google geocoding with PostGIS procedure
- open in new tab doesn't work
- is batching possible with postgraphql yet?
- maybe component WarningMessage could just be Italic or Light span
- lighter gray color on shareholder name if not a registered user
