### 2.0.4

- [ ] more big clean up
  - RelationshipList pagination
  - share page should show how many credits were bought, maybe vouchers have #3/5
  - create voucher doesn't have a visible token--check API?
  - home page: show featured products

  - make form text size responsive, bigger than it is currently on medium and large desktop
  - form start date and end date side by side
  - add location input to new user
  - remove yellow background focused text input (shows up on login/signup forms)
  - auto-generate vouchers and remove "create voucher"
  - don't show canceled shares as shareholders on product page
  - is batching possible with postgraphql yet?
  - maybe component WarningMessage could just be Italic or Light span

### 2.0.5

- can browse page use router queries and state in a better way?
- image hosting
- might want to hide token unless user wants to see it
- deleting a product
- customer contact should be email or phone
- allow for "double" or "half shares"
- Layout props for flex elements
- check Google geocoder calls for redudancy

- since internet connection may not be great at markets and on farms, be sure profile page has all needed voucher tokens and maybe have a pdf download of vouchers
- notes for shares or vouchers could be additive (arrays) rather than single items that get updated
- maybe add date field(s) to voucher
- replace Google geocoding with PostGIS procedure
- open in new tab doesn't work
