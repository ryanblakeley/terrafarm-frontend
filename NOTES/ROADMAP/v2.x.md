### 2.0.4

- [ ] more big clean up
  - share page should show how many credits were bought, maybe vouchers have #3/5
  - browse results, if list is empty, don't show any items
  - create voucher doesn't have a visible token--check API?

  - form start date and end date side by side
  - add location input to new user
  - remove yellow background focused text input (shows up on login/signup forms)

  - assign/order punch card consolidated into one form and mutation "create punch card"?
  - deleting a product
  - since internet connection may not be great at markets and on farms, be sure profile page has all needed voucher tokens and maybe have a pdf download of vouchers
  - notes for shares or vouchers could be additive (arrays) rather than single items that get updated
  - customer contact should be email or phone
  - auto-generate vouchers and remove "create voucher"
  - allow for "double" or "half shares"
  - profile page voucher list, filter by status
  - maybe add date field(s) to voucher
  - maybe add status "ready" to voucher
  - RelationshipList pagination
  - Layout props for flex elements: MainContentWrapper

### 2.0.5

- can browse page use router queries and state in a better way?
- image hosting
- might want to hide token unless user wants to see it
