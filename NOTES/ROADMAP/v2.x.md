# Terrafarm CSA Frontend Roadmap

## v2.x

### 2.0.1

- [x] products browse menu
- order share mutation

- share status life cycle: pending/declined/valid/expired
- does share have a uuid of its own?
- "Add a shareholder" button in Product menu if user is product owner
  - /product/abc123-123defs/add-shareholder form
  - status valid
- "Order a share" button in Product menu if user is not product owner
  - /product/abc123-123defs/order-share form
  - status pending
- "Review a share" link to left of share list item on product page if product owner
  - form shows current status in select menu, owner can change it to any other status in dropdown
  - save, cancel, no delete
- on profile page, shares shown in list should link product name to product page and share status to share page
- product owner goes to share page to change status, on his product page, the shareholder name links to person status links to share page

- product: min-shares, max-shares, min-price, max-price
- product owner validates the share manually or by giving a key to the buyer
- if logged in as product owner, menu says "Add a shareholder" instead of "Order a share"
  - share is created with "customer_name" and other plain text fields for the customer
  - this customer data lives only in the share that is created
  - there is no table abstraction for manually entered customer identities
- product owner has to be able to manually add shareholders who aren't app users.



- [ ] on Product page, be able to initiate a transaction for a share
  - I like this product, I more than want to star it. I want to transact for it.
  - Price should be set by product owner, maybe a range.
  - Open a form that is for the request to buy a share.
  - product owner reviews the form via link status icon in the side panel on product page
  - request is not viewable by potential shareholder (as initial demo, not necessary...except show *that* a message was sent)
  - if user has a farm with products, allow user to submit their own product as a proposed trade, with a balance possibly
  - encourage users to post resources that are suitable for selling product shares: tractor, seeds, etc.

- [ ] on Product page, make farm subheader a link, change icon
- [ ] create and edit product forms: validations and data types (currency, date)
- [ ] "not found" pattern on product, farm, user pages
- [ ] maybe recycle farm member logic for share transaction.

- Stars
  - put to left of title
  - how to browse your own and see others?
    - [ ] star button next to title of page
- Browse
  - get rid of location field, user can use the map
  - full width search button (easier to click on)
  - submit on enter
  - formsy external issues on Github
