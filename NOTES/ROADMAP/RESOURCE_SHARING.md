## Resource Sharing

### Story
- Post resources such as land, labor, equipment, compost, seeds, and materials.
- Create organizations, projects, and tasks; and at any of those three levels describe resource requirements.
- Offer or request resources that match requirement descriptions; and the other party accepts or declines the engagement.

### Details
Organizations are parent objects for Projects, and Projects are parent objects for Tasks.

Organizations, Projects, and Tasks can have Wish Lists which describe resource requirements.

A resource owner may offer one of his or her resources to an Organization, Project, or Task. 

A user with permission to request a resource can do so from the resource page or the organziation, project, or task page.

In the future, wish list items might have a field `candidateResources`. With this feature, a user offering or requesting a resource could indicate a wish list item that the offer or request is linked to.

Depending on which party initiates the connection, the other party is given a notice and has the ability to respond Yes or No.

In the future it would be good to add "resource availability". Allocation would need to be temporally specific.
