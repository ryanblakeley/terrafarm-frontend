# Terrafarm Frontend Roadmap

## v1.x

### 1.0.7 Dec 2

- on a request or offer, user leaves contact card
  - multi-line text input where the user can leave whatever message they want
  - contact card is only visible to the people involved in the transaction
    - resource owner
    - organization members
    - task author
  - user can set up a default calling card in profile
  - this design gives user the ability to set up communication however they want
- show location on task page

### 1.0.8 Dec 4

- use LatLngBounds.getCenter() and always pass the bounds, rather than center around

- BrowseForm
  - [ ] has current location button

- BrowseMap
  - [x] when map changes, gets bounds and sets into location.query
  - [ ] when click marker, display as active item in BrowseList
    - location.query.focusedResultItemId

- BrowseList
  - [ ] clicking name sets focusedResultsItemId in BrowseMap
    - [x] func passed in to RelationshipList
    - [ ] RelationshipListItem click handler on icon for map pin

- Notes
  - maybe put things that don't get passed to db on location.state instead of query
  - delete old files
  - fix browse form layout
  - link to stack info in about page
  - maybe separate text field from description (org, task) for describing resources you're looking for
  - icon button animations
  - update google-maps-react when new version is published

### 1.0.9 Dec 7

- mobile touch menu doesn't work
- [x] mobile issue with new header buttons
- BROKEN
  - buttons for 'task resource form' are not showing to task author
  - inconsistent results for which buttons show depending on nav origin

- if user is not shown buttons in an action panel, explain why
  - requested resource -> "You requested this resource for this organization. You can delete the request. The resource owner will accept or decline the request."
  - or show a message that describes the status in the lifecycle and who is going to be acting next
- visibility of menu buttons to specific logged in users

- [ ] browse pagination, sort
