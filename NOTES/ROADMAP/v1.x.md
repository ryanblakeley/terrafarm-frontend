# Terrafarm Frontend Roadmap

## v1.x

### 1.0.3 Nov 8

- [x] test that all urls show correct forms
- block urls for forms where not authorized
- handle router case if path=':______Id' param is invalid
  - happens after a delete object mutation -- history needs replace rather than push
- add `onFailure` callbacks to mutations that fail
  - happens with permission denied
- new action menu

- test that mutations work
  - [x] all creates
  - [x] all edits
  - [ ] all deletes
    - [x] delete task works
    - [x] delete project works -- tasks are orphaned
    - [x] delete organization works -- projects are orphaned
    - [ ] delete resource leaves false connections in Relay

- [ ] when someone creates a project or task, make them a member
- implement `viewer` (see currentPerson)
  - update forms for "offer resource" to populate from viewer's resources
    - if empty, have warning message to create a resource
  - on resource page, request button, show only organizations, project, and tasks where viewer is member
- note the invite process in the ui <host>/profile/join-organization/<id>

- delete or move create-color-chart into utils
- maybe put containers in `/src/<container>/containers/<container>Container`
- maybe put queries in `/src/<container>/queries/`
- wrap all material-ui components and clean up props

- do we want to have `isAdmin` be a standard context property that says whether
  the user is authorized to change the current page?
