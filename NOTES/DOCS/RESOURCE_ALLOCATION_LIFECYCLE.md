## Resource Allocation Lifecycle

User creates resources. Another user creates organization, project, or task.
Resource owner offers or organization member requests a resource. The other party
accepts or declines the allocation.

If a user goes to offer a resource and doesn't have any saved in his profile, we
show a warning message and do not show the form. Otherwise, the form consists of
a single select input with a menu of resources that the current person has created
in the app.
