# Terrafarm Frontend Roadmap

## Join Organization

- Organization members invite other people who accept or decline the offer.
- No requests to join an organization.

- How does the offer happen?
  - Member is logged in and on page for organization.
  - Menu item "New Member"
  - Select input with list of users current person has starred
  - "Save" button submits the membership invitation to the selected person

- How does the accept/decline happen?
  - Member status 'offered' show in UI for lists of members, links to form
  - Person who receives invitation goes to url with form to accept or decline
  - Not critical, but it would be good if invitation could be invalidated.
  - Would it be better to change status when person leaves organization or delete the member row?
